This Repo contain FASTMCP client and FASTMCP  server code. FASTMCP  Server contain ADK agent

Here's a polished **README.md** template for your **FastMCP-ADK-Server-Client** repository. Since I can't see the precise contents of your `client.py`, `server.py`, and the `README.md` that exists, feel free to tweak the details (like usage examples or dependencies) to match your actual implementation.

# FastMCP-ADK-Server-Client

A demo project that combines **FastMCP** and **Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK)** to build a powerful MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and client setup.

---

## Overview

This repository includes:

- **server.py** — A FastMCP-based server, wrapping ADK agents to expose tools via MCP.
- **client.py** — A FastMCP client to interact with the MCP server programmatically.
- **requirements.txt** — Python dependencies needed for setup.
- An optional `.env` for configuration (e.g. keys, endpoints).

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+  
- `uv` package manager (optional, but recommended for easier dependency handling)

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shdhumale/FastMCP-ADK-Server-Client.git
cd FastMCP-ADK-Server-Client

# Using uv (recommended)
uv run install

# Or with pip directly
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## Usage

### 1. Starting the MCP Server

```bash
python server.py
```

This launches your FastMCP server bundled with ADK agents. The server will begin listening for incoming MCP requests.

### 2. Running the Client

```bash
python client.py
```

This will initiate the FastMCP client, which can:

* Connect to the MCP server
* List available tools, resources, or prompts
* Send requests to the server (e.g., invoking a tool)

## Project Structure

```
├── client.py            # FastMCP client implementation
├── server.py            # FastMCP server implementing ADK agents

└── .env                 # Optional config file for API keys or endpoints
```

## How It Works

* **FastMCP** simplifies building MCP servers & clients with a Pythonic decorator-based interface ([GitHub][1], [FastMCP][2]).
* **ADK (Agent Development Kit)** lets you embed intelligent agent logic—tools, session state, event handling—into the MCP server.

When combined, this repo enables:

1. Declarative creation of tools via FastMCP in `server.py`.
2. High-level client interaction in `client.py`.
3. Modular, agentic behavior through ADK integration.

---

## Notes & Tips

* Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.
* Populate `.env` for any required API credentials or environment configuration.
* Depending on your setup, you might add documentation or logging for better traceability.

---

## Contributing

You're welcome to contribute enhancements! Here are a few ideas:

* Add new ADK agents or MCP tools.
* Improve command-line flags or configuration options.
* Include better logging, error-handling, or testing.

To contribute:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create your branch (e.g., `feature/new-tool`).
3. Commit and push your changes.
4. Submit a Pull Request.

## Acknowledgements

* Built with **FastMCP** — the high-level MCP framework for Python ([GitHub][1]).
* Leveraging **Google’s ADK** for intelligent agent integration.
